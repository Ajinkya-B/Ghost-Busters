# We are the GhostBusters!
Companies use chatbots to redirect traffic from live customer service. But sometimes, a customer quits a chat for some specific reason and would instead call the live customer service representative.

Often times, companies who use chatbots don't know when and why this happens and end up spending top of time and resources.

We're going to help businesses that use Voiceflow's chatbot identify why their customers are leaving their chatbots by creating an analytics dashboard that displays various reasons why users quit a chat from the data aggregated on the instances of customers leaving a conversation.
